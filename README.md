```
enum ClientStatus {
  OFFLINE = 0;
  ONLINE = 1;
  BUSY = 2;  
}

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for NET developers who are working with microservices and are looking for efficient solutions to facilitate communication between services using gRPC. Anyone who is familiar with microservices architecture and has knowledge of the fundamentals of .NET Core, but not necessarily of gRPC, will also find this book useful.
